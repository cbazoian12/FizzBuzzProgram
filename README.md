# FizzBuzzProgram
This is a generic coding exercise that is often required in interviews and coding challenges. For numbers 1 to 100, if the number is a multiple of 3, it prints "Fizz", if the number is a multiple of 5, it prints "Buzz", and it prints "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are a multiple of both. Done in C#.
